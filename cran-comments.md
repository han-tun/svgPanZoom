## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case - htmlwidget now is Htmlwidget

* Changed to MIT | file License to more clearly identify the MIT license for the package
    and BSD license for the component JavaScript license using other CRAN approved htmlwidgets
    as a template for the file LICENSE
    


## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.1.2
* ubuntu (on travis-ci), R 3.2.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were 2 notes:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

Yes this is a new submission

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  
No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped
