## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* SVGAnnotation included in DESCRIPTION/Suggests is available on Bioconductor http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/extra/html/SVGAnnotation.html

* Single-quote all js and R packages so they do not appear as mis-spelled

* Add a simple example in roxygen outside of donttest

 
## Test environments

* local Windows install, R 3.1.2

* ubuntu (on travis-ci), R 3.2.1

* win-builder (devel and release)


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
