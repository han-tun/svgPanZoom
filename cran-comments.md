## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* SVGAnnotation included in DESCRIPTION/Suggests is available on Bioconductor http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/extra/html/SVGAnnotation.html

* Single-quote all js and R packages so they do not appear as mis-spelled

* Add a simple example in roxygen outside of donttest
